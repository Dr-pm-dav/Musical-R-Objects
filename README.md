# Musical-R-Objects

Online radio keeps track of everything that you play. This information is used to make recommendations to you for additional music. 

This project used a large data set that was mined with *arules* in R to recommend new music to a community of radio listeners that has 300k records & 15k users.

The deliverables:

- The results should be provided with a detailed explanation of the instructions on how you produced the results.
- Discuss how the data were structured so that if one person listens to 5 different artists, that will be 5 rows in the data set.
- Describe and show how to use *arules* for the mining association rules.
- Describe how the data became an R matrix.
- Show how you constructed the rule that shows that an artist provided lift to other artists.
